# Advanced HTML Mastery Roadmap

A comprehensive learning path for mastering advanced HTML concepts and techniques for elite-level frontend development. This roadmap is built entirely on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) as the primary reference source.

## Prerequisites

This roadmap assumes you already have solid knowledge of:
- Basic HTML elements and structure
- Fundamental CSS styling
- Basic JavaScript concepts
- Web development workflow basics

## Quick Start

1. **Sequential Learning**: Follow the modules in order (00-08) for a structured approach
2. **Reference Mode**: Jump to specific modules based on your current needs
3. **Hands-on Practice**: Each module includes practical exercises and real-world examples
4. **MDN Deep Dives**: All concepts link directly to MDN documentation for authoritative reference
